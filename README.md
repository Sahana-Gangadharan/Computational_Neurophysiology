# Computational_Neurophysiology


Summer Internship on Computational Neurophysiology (May 2019 – July 2019)
Supervisor: Rishikesh Narayanan, Associate Professor, Molecular Biophysics Unit, IISc, Bangalore.

Research Synopsis:

•	Learnt concepts with implementation and analyses: ionic basis of action potentials, its propagation and synaptic transmission, by several assignments involving computational models in NEURON.

•	Built an original model that implements the contents of the following research article.
          
          James, et al., “An amplitude code transmits information at a visual synapse” - Nature Neuroscience, 22, 1140–1147, 20 May 2019.
          
•	Involved concepts and simulations of amplitude and rate coding in neurons.

•	Generating Poisson-distributed quantal-release, converting spike-trains to instantaneous firing rates.

•	Characterization of Neurophysiological and Electrophysiological properties.

In this repository, the questions and the codes for each assignment is listed. Further data related to the assignments are available at - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_SdS4BDXFWdPhRXarIh5QJ1SLtxN9B8V?usp=sharing

The project report, presentation, reference paper and the relavent codes are also uploaded.
